# PackageNameRepl
###A example for gradle which can replace java package name.
----
As we know, PackageName and ApplicationId is not the same concept. So sometimes, we need to change the PackageName but the ApplicationId. However, the Android gradle tools do not support it, and so we need this.

More info about it, please refer from http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/applicationid-vs-packagename
